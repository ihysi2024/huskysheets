1. Refactor model into two interfaces
    a. PlannerModel
        i. extends a ReadonlyPlannerModel
        ii. contains all the mutator methods
    b. ReadonlyPlannerModel
        i. should contain all the
        observation methods of your model

2. Create two frames
    a. one for event
        i. Text box for event name, location name, start time, end time
        ii. Drop down menu for online, starting day and ending day
        iii. JList for list of users
        iv. Modify event
        v. Remove event
    b. one for schedule and main system
        i. file menu to load an XML and another to export an XML
        ii. create event
        iii. schedule event
        iv. drop down menu for user to examine
        v. Color events on the schedule red

3. Design 2-4 Interfaces for view
    a. one to describe what main system's frame is capable of
    b. one to describe what the event's frame is capable of
    c. one might be needed to describe what the schedule panel
     ought to be capable of
    d. one might be needed to describe what the event
     frame's panel out to be capable of
    e. View constructor should take in a ReadonlyPlannerModel


5. Clicking on "create event" button should print a message using
System.out with the words "Create event:" and the event's details
Same with remove event.
6. Clicking on the red button to close the window should
dispose the window
7. Clicking the create/remove button should print a message
stating some kind of error.
8. XML loader should open a JFileChooser to allow the user to find
and select the XML then print the path to that XML file with System.out
9. add a PlannerRunner class as a placeholder
