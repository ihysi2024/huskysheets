- changed "Schedule" to "ISchedule" in several places
- deleted two methods having to do with strategies since we don't have to adapt those
- potentially wont be able to upload xml because we take in a file path but they take in a Document
- dont' think we can do removeUser in our planner system
- had to change "calculateTime" method so that code would compile
- provider 'saveCalendar' takes in a String but ours doesn't and grabs the String from the field within the view
    - changed our view / model to accomade this, now works for both our view and provider view
